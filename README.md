# Smart-Garbage-Management-System-Using-IOT

IoT Garbage Monitoring system is an advanced way which will help in keeping the cities clean and healthy. The system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins through garbage monitoring mobile app. For this, the system uses ultrasonic sensors with each placed at the top of the bins to detect garbage level and compare it with the garbage bins depth. The system uses Raspberry pi 3, LCD screen, WIFI modem for sending data along with a firebase system to store collected runtime data. This system is powered by 12V batteries. The LCD screen is required to display status of the level of garbage that is collected in the bins. While the mobile application is built to show status to the user monitoring it. The mobile application gives a graphical view of the garbage bins and highlights the garbage collected in color so as to show the level of garbage collected. The LCD screen show the status of the garbage level. The system puts on a buzzer when the level of garbage collected crosses the specified limit. So, the system will help to keep the city clean by providing acknowledgement about the garbage levels of the bins by providing graphical image of bins.

Objectives:
i.	Optimizes waste collection and its ultimately reduce the fuel consumption.
ii.	When the bin are placed at a particular position smartphone is required to detect its latitude and longitude.
iii.	This project will reduces the cost of overall system; as GPS will not be required then.  
Features:
i.	The smart, sensor based trashbin will detect the level of waste in it and will send the message directly to municipal corporation. 
ii.	It can sense all types of waste material no matter it is in the form of solid or liquid. 
iii.	According to the filled level of dustbin, vehicles from municipal corporation will choose the shortest path with the help of the “TRANSPORTATION SOFTWARE” which will save a measurable time.
iv.	It highlights “DIGITAL INDIA”.
v.	The system is simple, if there is any problem with any equipment in future, that part is easily replaceable with the new one without any difficulty or delay.
